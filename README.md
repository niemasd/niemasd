My name is (Alexander) Niema Moshiri, and I am an Assistant Teaching Professor in the [Computer Science & Engineering Department](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) at the [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). I work on computational biology, with a research focus on viral phylogenetics and epidemiology. I also place a heavy emphasis on teaching, namely on the development of online educational content, primarily Massive Adaptive Interactive Texts (MAITs). You can find more information about me on [my website](https://niema.net/) or in my [Curriculum Vitae (CV)](https://github.com/niemasd/curriculum-vitae/releases/latest/download/main.pdf).
